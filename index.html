                    <h2>Brief history</h2>
                    <p> My city, that is Poza Rica de Hidalgo. It is a city and its surrounding municipality in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Its name means "rich well/pond". It is often thought that the name came to be because it was a place known for its abundance of oil. In reality, before oil was discovered, there existed a pond rich in fish, which gave origin to the city’s name. In the last century oil was discovered in the area. It has since been almost completely extracted. This has resulted in the decline of oil well exploration and drilling activities, though there are still many oil facilities.</p>
                    <h2>Favorite food</h2>
                    <p>That would definetly be “Zacahuil”. It is a large tamal about 4-6 feet long and is cooked in a wood oven. It is popular in the Huastec Region, formed by the states of San Luis Potosi, Hidalgo, Tamaulipas, Veracruz, and even the State of Queretaro, where it is commonly sold on the weekends at the local markets, or cooked for weddings and other special events. The dough has a coarse texture, and the Zacahuil is usually filled with either pork or a mixture of pork, chicken, or turkey.</p>
